            Hacktoberfest is DigitalOceanâ€™s annual event that encourages people
            to contribute to open source throughout October. Much of modern tech
            infrastructure-including some of DigitalOceanâ€™s own products-relies
            on open-source projects built and maintained by passionate people
            who often donâ€™t have the staff or budgets to do much more than keep
            the project alive. Hacktoberfest is all about giving back to those
            projects, sharpening skills, and celebrating all things open source,
            especially the people that make open source so special. For the past
            10 years, thousands of people-coders and non-coders alike-have
            participated in Hacktoberfest to support the projects they use and
            love, learn and practice skills that will enhance their careers, and
            meet new people who love open source as much as they do.
